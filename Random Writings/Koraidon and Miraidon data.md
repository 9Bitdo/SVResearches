While dumping data from the Box block in my save file, I noticed there was data for my Koraidon (Scarlet) and Miraidon (Violet).

I noticed this in my Scarlet save file, and I was nearly into the first gym. 

I started theorize that the data might be there since the beginning of the game, and it would've been cool to extract and use it in my party.

I started a Violet game, then started to save & dump my save file in all the relevant quest point before encountering Miraidon.

I checked the Box block for every save dump. The Miraidon got generated and stored in the save after its encounter in the beach.

I dumped the Pok√©mon and RAM-Injected it in my party. It was shiny since I had my cheat for Shiny Unlock & Force Shiny activated when I first encountered it.

Unless pid/ivs/nature are rerolled upon obtaining, players who want to reset stats will have to restart the game from the beginning. There's no way to read its stats without peeking at ram or dumping the save file.
